# Why-do-I-sea


## Overview
What Do I Sea AI is an advanced machine learning project designed to revolutionize marine conservation efforts. By leveraging state-of-the-art image recognition algorithms, this system can identify and track various marine species in real-time, providing valuable data for researchers and conservationists.

## Features
- Real-time image recognition of marine species
- Integration with underwater camera systems
- Population tracking and trend analysis
- Endangered species alert system
- User-friendly web interface for data visualization

## Technology Stack
- Python 3.8+
- TensorFlow 2.x
- OpenCV
- Flask (for web interface)
- PostgreSQL (for data storage)

## Installation
1. Clone the repository:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/what-do-i-sea.git
   ```
2. Install dependencies:
   ```
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
3. Set up the PostgreSQL database (instructions in `database_setup.md`)
4. Run the application:
   ```
   python app.py
   ```

## Usage
1. Access the web interface at `http://localhost:5000`
2. Upload images or connect to live underwater camera feeds
3. View real-time species identification and population data
4. Generate reports and visualizations for conservation efforts
